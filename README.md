## Introduction

Commuting through a city is a hassle, whether driving, walking or biking. The London Bike Share Program is one of the most cost-effective ways to traverse the city. However, its usage of it seems to be affected by weather conditions, wind speed, and temperature. This project will aim to create a visualization to showcase these findings.
